 * limit the support so that we can put an upper bound on the time required
 * to compute an output value and on the amount of storage required for
 * X-filtered input data; this also allows us to use pre-scaled fixed-point
 * values for the weights if we wish.

/* We juggle 3 concepts here. Firstly, we are conceptually dealing with an
 * Entire image (say 256x256) - this size is EntireWidthIn by EntireHeightIn,
 * and would scale to be EntireWidthOut by EntireHeightOut.
 * Of this, because of the clist, we may only get data for a section of this
 * (say 32x32) - this size is WidthIn by HeightIn, and would scale
 * to be WidthOut by HeightOut.
 * Finally, we may actually only be rendering a smaller 'patch' of this
 * due to restriction by a clip path etc (say 16x16) - this size is
 * PatchWidthIn by PatchHeightIn, and would scale to be PatchWidthOut by
 * PatchHeightOut. We don't really need PatchHeightOut.
 *
 * There is one additional complication: Due to the 'support' requirements
 * of the scalers, we need to decode a slightly larger area than we
 * might think. Accordingly, we are fed 2 different rectangles. drect
 * tell us the area that must be decoded - we use this to calculate
 * the 'In' values. rrect tells us the area that must be rendered - we
 * use this to calculate the 'Out' values.

 *     with appropriate scale factors!
 *
 * Certain values in this diagram are not currently used within
 * gs. DX and SX are always 0, due to banding cutting only on
 * Y. If there are cases where the clist code is truncating
 * the width of images, then we will be getting incorrect (read
 * "marginally sub optimal") results. DY is not supplied, which
 * I suspect leads to each band being potentially off by a subpixel
 * amount in the Y direction.
